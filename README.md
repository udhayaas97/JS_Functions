JAVASCRIPT & TYPESCRIPT Questions and Answers

1. Write a JavaScript program to get the current date.

Expected Output :
60째C is 140 째F

3. Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into small squares.
Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable. 
Implement a function that will return the minimum number of breaks needed.

For example if you are given a chocolate bar of size 2 x 1 
you can split it into single squares in just one break,
but for size 3 x 1 you must do two breaks.

If input data is invalid you should return 0 (as in no breaks are
needed if we do not have any chocolate to split). Input will always
be a non-negative integer.


4. A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. 
Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, 
continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced.
This is only applicable to the natural numbers.

Here's how it works:
digital_root(16)
=> 1 + 6
=> 7
digital_root(942)
=> 9 + 4 + 2
=> 15 ...
=> 1 + 5
=> 6
digital_root(132189)
=> 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9
=> 24 ...
=> 2 + 4
=> 6
digital_root(493193)
=> 4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3
=> 29 ...
=> 2 + 9
=> 11 ...
=> 1 + 1
=> 2


5. Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list that contains each number of lst at most N times without reordering.
For example if N = 2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], 
you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, 
and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].

Example
 deleteNth ([1,1,1,1],2) // return [1,1]
 deleteNth ([20,37,20,21],1) // return [20,37,21]
